Description
-----------
  This program is a console based text version of Blackjack. At its current
state the program can only account for one player versus the dealer. The
program consists of continual prompts to the user to drive the game. There
are several dialogs in between that delineate the current state of the game.

How to run
----------
  To run the game one simply has to be in the correct directory labeled
  'Blackjack' and insure their python is up to date.
  From here all that is needed is to type:

    python main.py

Testing
-------
  I tested the game by simply typing in several scenarios into
the terminal and checking to see if they returned the expected
result for the scenario ( i.e. if the player was supposed to win with
the current hand did the game return that? )

Design Choices
--------------
  I implemented the use of a normal array, and a stack for keeping
track of the player and the dealers current hand.

Choice of Tooling
-----------------
  For the program I utilized Python as I was not too concerned with
the program needing to be quick to run. In addition, python facilitated
the writing of the program as it allowed for easier handling of data
structures. I also used python 'random' library for generating a pseudorandom
deck needed to start the game. Also the use of git for version management. r
